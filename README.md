# Census-Data-Analysis

Synopsis:

Consider the following hypothetical scenario. You are a government-employed data analyst
working for the United States Congress. For the lawmakers to make laws tailored for American
people, it is of paramount importance to have a clear picture of how ‘typical Americans’ look
like demographically. In this reason, the U.S. Constitution mandates census surveys and the U.S.
Census Bureau, a nonpartisan government agency, conducts the survey every 10 years. The
census provides critical data that lawmakers use to provide support for citizens and their
communities. Every year, billions of dollars in federal funding go to hospitals, fire departments,
schools, roads, and other services based on census data.

Data Source:

You must use the 1990 U.S. Census Data Set available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository
(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/US+Census+Data+%281990%29). It is comprised of
census data of 2.5 million individuals represented by 68 categorical variables. When necessary,
other public data sources (e.g. https://www.data.gov/) or your own custom-scraped data set
could be used to augment the census data set.

The mission:

Choose variables that you think is relevant for law/policy making. Map those variables into
appropriate numerical representations suitable for clustering. Perform cluster analysis using
Spark. See how many clusters exist in the census data set and how each of the clusters look like.
Conduct statistical analysis and show summary statics for each cluster. From the analysis,
derive prototypical examples of “average Americans.” (e.g. mean/median of each cluster).
